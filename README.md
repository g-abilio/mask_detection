# Real Time Mask Detection

### Introduction 

This repo uses various computer vision technologies, such as deep learning, image acquisition, image processing, feature recognition, and many more, to produce a Real Time Mask Detection application. 

### Instructions for Use

1. Clone the repo: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:g-abilio/mask_detection.git

```

3. Run the following command:
